### Task 0 :
        This program will assign a random signed number to the variable 'number' each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable 'number' is positive or negative, using loop :
program [0-positive_or_negative.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)

### Task 1 :
        This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number, using loop :
program [1-last_digit.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py)

### Task 2 :
        Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line (Use only one print function with string format, Use only one loop in your code, You are not allowed to store characters in a variable, You are not allowed to import any module) :
program [2-print_alphabet.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/2-print_alphabet.py)

### Task 3 :
        Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. (Print all the letters except q and e) :
program [3-print_alphabt.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/3-print_alphabt.py)

### Task 4 :
        Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example) :
program [4-print_hexa.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/4-print_hexa.py)

### Task 5 :
        Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.Numbers must be separated by ',', followed by a space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits, only use no more than 2 'print' :
program [5-print_comb2.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/5-print_comb2.py)

### Task 6 :
        Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.Numbers must be separated by ',', followed by a space, The two digits must be different, 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1, Print only the smallest combination of two digits, Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits, only use no more 3 'print' :
program [6-print_comb3.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/6-print_comb3.py)

### Task 7 :
        Write a function that checks for lowercase character. Prototype: 'def islower(c):', Returns True if c is lowercase, Returns False otherwise, You are not allowed to import any module, You are not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper(), Tips: ord() :
program [7-islower.py]()

### Task 8 :
        Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.Prototype: 'def uppercase(str):', You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format, You can only use one loop in your code :, You are not allowed to import any module, You are not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper(), Tips: ord() :
program [8-uppercase.py]()

### Task 9 :
        Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. Prototype: 'def print_last_digit(number):', Returns the value of the last digit, You are not allowed to import any module :
program [9-print_last_digit.py]()

### Task 10 :
        Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result. Prototype: 'def add(a, b):', Returns the value of a + b, You are not allowed to import any module :
program [10-add.py]()

### Task 11 :
        Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.Prototype: 'def pow(a, b):', Returns the value of a ^ b, You are not allowed to import any module :
program [11-pow.py]()

### Task 12 :
        Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. Prototype: 'def fizzbuzz():', Each element should be followed by a space, You are not allowed to import any module :
program [12-fizzbuzz.py]()
