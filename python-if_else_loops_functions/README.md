### Task 0 :
        This program will assign a random signed number to the variable 'number' each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable 'number' is positive or negative, using loop :
program [0-positive_or_negative.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)

### Task 1 :
        This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number, using loop :
program [1-last_digit.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py)

### Task 2 :
        Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line (Use only one print function with string format, Use only one loop in your code, You are not allowed to store characters in a variable, You are not allowed to import any module) :
program [2-print_alphabet.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/2-print_alphabet.py)

### Task 3 :
        Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. (Print all the letters except q and e) :
program [3-print_alphabt.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/3-print_alphabt.py)

### Task 4 :
        Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example) :
program [4-print_hexa.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/4-print_hexa.py)

### Task 5 :
        Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.Numbers must be separated by ',', followed by a space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits, only use no more than 2 'print' :
program [5-print_comb2.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/5-print_comb2.py)

### Task 6 :
        Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.Numbers must be separated by ',', followed by a space, The two digits must be different, 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1, Print only the smallest combination of two digits, Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits, only use no more 3 'print' :
program [6-print_comb3.py](https://github.com/Mylliah/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/6-print_comb3.py)
