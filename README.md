## Project 14 : RESTful API
    RESTful API Project – Overview
    This project explores the fundamentals and implementation of RESTful APIs, which are essential for efficient and scalable communication between software systems. It covers both the consumption and development of APIs using tools like the command line, Python, and Flask, and emphasizes the importance of security, authentication, and documentation.

    Key Learning Objectives
    - HTTP/HTTPS Basics: Understand how web data transfer works and the differences between secure and non-secure communication.
    - API Consumption: Practice interacting with APIs using the command line and Python scripts.
    - API Development:
        - With http.server: Create simple APIs using Python's built-in modules.
        - With Flask: Build scalable APIs with routing and data handling.
    - Security & Authentication: Learn how to protect APIs and restrict access to authorized users.
    - Documentation with OpenAPI: Ensure APIs are well-documented, standardized, and easy to use.

    Why It Matters
    RESTful APIs are at the heart of modern web integration—connecting apps, services, and databases across platforms. From automating industrial systems to enabling social media features, APIs act as the bridge between different technologies. Mastering their use is key to becoming a well-rounded developer.
